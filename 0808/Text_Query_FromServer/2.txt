    Many people prefer to travel by air. This is because air travel has some advantages. In the first place, airplane, the miracle created by man, is the fastest means of transport. It takes the least time for one to travel by air from one place to another. Secondly, traveling by air is convenient and comfortable. Friendly air hostesses are affectionate and considerate. They look after passengers all the way to their destinations. Moreover, on long distance flights there are films and music for people to entertain themselves.

　　As a popular saying goes, “Everything has two sides.” The same is true of air travel. It has some disadvantages, too. For one thing, air travel costs a great deal. The average Chinese are not rich enough to afford expensive air fares. So they prefer to take trains, which save a lot of money. For another, although passengers are assured of their safety, they are still worried about it during the journey because flying always involves more or less risk.

　　As far as I am concerned, the advantages mentioned above exceed the disadvantages. If I were given choice between traveling by air and traveling by train, I would certainly prefer the former. For me, time is money and it is the most important thing I have to take into consideration whatever I do. (216 words)
